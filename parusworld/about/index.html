            <p>Sonarika had bagged her first show when she was in class 11. She went to a party with her aunt, who is a designer. It was then that she was spotted by a casting guy who had asked her to come for an audition.</p>
            <p>But her dad never gave her the permission for acting. He wanted her to complete her 12th standard before entering into the showbiz industry. On Father’s Day, she requested her dad to allow her to try her luck into acting, and her dad, like a loving father, accepted her demand. But unfortunately the show never saw the light of the day!</p>
