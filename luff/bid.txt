Hello Luff. I read your requirements and created a sample website to show you. Here's the link : https://projects.saicharan.com/luff/

You may have noticed that position & size of background video looks similar to Roma Capital's video. But there's also another thing which is similar to Roma Capital's website: if you visit the site on a mobile you'll notice a background IMAGE instead of video background. (You can also check this on your computer by resizing your browser window)

The reason why they used background image instead of background video is - usually file size of videos will be large, so in order to avoid wasting users bandwidth (mobile-data), it's a common practice to replace background video with an image. Also, in some mobile devices, autoplay feature is disabled by default.

I hope that sample website would help you in deciding whether or not to hire me :) 

In case if you're interested, message me the details of your existing website. I'll replace the slider with a video and show you my work.

Thanks for your time,
Sai
