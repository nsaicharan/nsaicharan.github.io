Hi Pixel! I see you're looking for developer who can redirect users who visit your new URL to another website.

There are few limitations, but still it's possible to display your new URL after redirecting it other website.

Check this link: https://projects.saicharan.com/pixel

You'll notice that when you visit the above URL in COMPUTER, it redirects to https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/, but you'll still see https://projects.saicharan.com/pixel as a URL. 

When you visit the the same URL in MOBILES, it redirects to https://labnol.org.

Is that how you wanted it to be? Let me know if you have any questions.
